# weather-app

Followed a tutorial to create a live weather app for my location. Utilized a [weather API](https://openweathermap.org/), React, and React Hooks. I also used this [patch](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React/issues/4287#issuecomment-1016579332) to enable <code>semantic-ui-css</code>.
